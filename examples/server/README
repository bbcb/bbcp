# This example demonstrates simple server based on console version of BlackBox.

# To run this example you need to build 'Interp' version of BlackBox:

# 1. Go to the BlackBox folder
cd ../../BlackBox

# 2. Clean previous
./switch-target none
./clean

# 3. Switch to BlackBox Interp and compile
./switch-target `uname -s` Interp
./build

# 4. Go to the example folder and compile the example
cd ../examples/server
echo "DevCompiler.CompileThis TcpService TcpServer TcpBytes TcpTask Init" | ../../BlackBox/run-BlackBox

# 5. Stop any other server that using 80 ports (apache, nginx, ...)
# 6. Then you can start server using command:

sudo ./bbserver

# To check the work of the server open browser and look the page http://localhost

# There are scripts ./start and ./stop for the daemon start and stop modes
